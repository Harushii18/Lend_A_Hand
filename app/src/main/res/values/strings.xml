    <!--How it works texts-->
    <string name="Donor_how_it_works">To get started on donating items to the people in need you just have to follow 2 easy steps :)</string>
    <string name="Donor_step1">Click on the \"Donate\" button or select \"Donate items\" in the navigation bar. </string>
    <string name="Donor_step2">Select the category you wish to donate to (can be more than one) and you will be redirected to a list of items. Indicate the quantity on each item you donate. You may click on the Shopping Cart icon to see all the items you have donated. Click on the \"Checkout\" button to finalize your donation. That is it!</string>
    <string name="Donor_Note">Please note that these requests and donations are province based, meaning that you will only donate to people in your province, this makes it easier for our courier services. In addition, in each category, you will only be able to donate items that have been requested in your province. A courier will arrive to fetch your donation.</string>
    <string name="how_it_works">To get started on getting your requests delivered to your door you just have to follow 2 easy steps :)</string>
    <string name="step1">Click on the \"Request\" button or select \"Request items\" in the navigation bar. </string>
    <string name="step2">Select the category you wish to request from (can be more than one) and you will be redirected to a list of items. Indicate the quantity you require on each item you request. You may click on the Shopping Cart icon to see all the items you have requested. Click on the \"Checkout\" button to finalize your request. That is it!</string>
    <string name="Note">Please note that these requests and donations are province based, meaning that the donations you receive will be from your province, this makes it easier for our courier services. In addition, if you happen to have multiple requests, it might occur that you will receive donations from multiple donors. To limit the amount of deliveries in this case, there will be a 5 day window period from the date of your first item request is donated and the delivery date so that donations can be accumulated to minimize deliveries. However, if all your requested items are ready for delivery then you will not have a window period to receive your items. </string>

    <!--About Us Text-->
    <string name="Creators">The creators of the Lend A Hand application are Suraksha Motilal and Fezile Mahlangu, who are currently doing 2nd Year Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand. They created this app for a mobile computing software development project aimed to help users during the covid-19 pandemic. They saw fit to make this specific app as they were witnesses to people struggling because of the pandemic.</string>
    <string name="Objective">Our objective is to essentially help people by connecting those who can help with those who need help in their respective provinces. Our courier services serve to limit exposure of the corona virus to our users because we know that the safest way to protect yourself is by staying home. Our objective is to create a safe and easy way for donations to occur, as your safety is a priority.   </string>

        We at Lend a Hand are pleased to have you join our large community of donees all over South Africa.

        To get started, simply log in and select the items you need and our couriers will arrive when a donor donates those items within 5 working days of the donation. Not all requests will be fulfilled immediately, as donees are on a waiting list. This means that donees are served on a first come, first serve basis, and the delivery of goods is dependent on the number of donors that we have. Requests that are made first will be attended to first once a donation for that particular item is made.

        Please ensure that all your contact and location details are correct, as we will be contacting you to ensure that all requests and donations are successful.

        Once a request is made, or a donation is on its way to you, you will be notified. The request details and estimated date of delivery will be emailed to you, as well as accessible through the app.
